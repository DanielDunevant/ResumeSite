		<h2>My Website </h2><br>
		<p class="half">
	Hi visiter. This site is about showing what I do and plan to do as a programmer.
		There's also some content like a blog and such non-sense. If you're a potential employer
		you can take a look at my resumes at the resume link or look at what projects I'm working on
		on the plans page. Alternatively you could go to the about page and learn a bit about me.
		 Take a look around.
		It's  written in MVC design style. This
		style is  very advantagious when working  in medium  sized groups. It's
		both  organized and has the added  benefit of  modularization.

<h2>About</h2>
                <p>I'm a programmer. I have a great interest in the field of computer science. I'm a lifelong learner that calls from a diverse set of skillsets.  I write music, short stories(on occasion), and also perform improv.  In addition to all this I enjoy a good conversation about ideas in general. In pursuit of that I now run an meetup called NWI DeepThinkers. </p>
                <p>I aspire to  do many things. I aspire to become a leader in my community. I aspire everyday to be better than  my former self. In time I also want to become a great programmer.</p>

<h2>My Current Projects</h2>
		<p>My current project is this site itself. I've explained how this site is contructed to a certain extent. To reitterate it is a site that uses MVC structure as PHP as the serverside language. Another side of this site is the blogs. I really enjoy the writing of these blogs. It's possible that they help people. Mostly I know they help me. There is nothing more valuable to me than the pursuit of the truth. If I can get others inspired to search for truth and meaning that would be great. I however don't have that goal. I forget the end and have peace in the doing.</p>
