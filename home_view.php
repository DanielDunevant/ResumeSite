		<p>Hi visiter. This site is about showing what I do and plan to do as a programmer.
		There's also some content like a blog and such non-sense. If you're a potential employer
		you can take a look at my resumes at the resume link or look at what projects I'm working on
		on the plans page. Alternatively you could go to the about page and learn a bit about me.
		 Take a look around.
		It's  written in MVC design style. This
		style is  very advantagious when working  in medium  sized groups. It's
		both  organized and has the added  benefit of  modularization.
    		</p>
