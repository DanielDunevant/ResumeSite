		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I’m a programmer. I have a great interest in the field of computer science.
		I’m a lifelong learner that calls from a diverse set of skillsets.  I write music,
		 short stories(on occasion), and also perform improv.  In addition to all this I enjoy a 
		good conversation about ideas in general. In pursuit of that I now run an meetup called NWI Deep
		Thinkers.
		</p>
		<p>I aspire to  do many things. I aspire to become a leader in my community.
		 I aspire everyday to be better than  my former self. In time I also want to
 		become a great programmer.</p>
