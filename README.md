Restarting my Resume Site  Project With MVC Structure

Hi guys. This is my resume site github page. I'm from here on for a while going to  be commiting every day. This site is indeed a work in progress but it offers a great deal of functionality.

There's a lot going on here. From the  blogs to  my project plans there's a lot of  content. Hopefully not so much so that it makes people want to look away. 

In this and following years I'll be documenting a lot more.
